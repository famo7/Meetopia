            Why I Built Meetopia

            <p>
              After one too many meetings where we talked in circles but nothing actually got done, I decided to build
              Meetopia.
              I was tired of scattered notes, forgotten action items, and that sinking feeling that we'd just wasted
              everyone's time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Meetopia is my attempt to fix thisâ€”a simple tool that turns meeting discussions into clear, actionable
              outcomes.
              Try it out and let me know what you think.
